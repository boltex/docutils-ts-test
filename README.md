# docutils-ts-test

This project is for trying out and experimenting with the [docutils-ts](https://github.com/boltex/docutils-ts) library. `docutils-ts` is a TypeScript port of the original Python 'docutils' library.

## Setup and Usage

To experiment with the `docutils-ts` library using this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/boltex/docutils-ts-test.git
    cd docutils-ts-test
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:** This command will install the `docutils-ts` library and other necessary TypeScript build tools.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Experiment:**
    *   The `src/index.ts` file contains some sample imports and function calls to the `docutils-ts` library. You can run it as-is or modify it to explore different functionalities.
5.  **Build and Run Scripts:**
    *   The `package.json` file includes scripts for building and running the project.
    *   If you are using Visual Studio Code, these scripts should be visible in the 'NPM SCRIPTS' section, typically found below the file explorer in the side tab. You can run them from there.

    To run the project from the command line:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```
